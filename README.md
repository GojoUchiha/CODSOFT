Welcome to my Machine Learning Internship Portfolio! 
In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. 
Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. 

Below is a summary of the projects:
Task_1. MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION
Description: 
Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. 
You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.
I chose to use Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression..

Task_3. CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
Description: 
Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription- based service or business. 
Use historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.
I have used Logistic Regression.

Task_4. SPAM SMS DETECTION
Description: 
Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.
Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages.
I have used Logistic Regression in this as well.

I am grateful for the opportunity provided by CodSoft. I have learnt a lot from this experience and hope to use that to further my expertise!!!
